# Image Restoration in Frequency Domain

## Problem Statement

### Problem
Given a blurred image of a heart, the task is to recover the degraded function. It is known that, the bottom right corner crosshair image before degraded, is 3 pixels wide, 30 pixels long, and had an intensity of 255.

Further more, try to restore the original image.

The heart image is given as follow:

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/thaiquangphat/Image-Restoration-in-Frequency-Domain/blob/main/image/heart.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img src="image/heart.jpg" alt="logo" style="width: 350px; height: auto; align: center">
    </a>
    <p><em>Blurred heart image</em></p>
</div>

### Assumptions

Upon solving this problem, we consider the following assumption:
- <b>No knowledge of the original heart image:</b> We will recover the degraded image as to verify the correctness of the degraded function, with not having the original heart image, thus at the restored result, we accept the result to our understanding.


## Approach

A detailed explanation of our approach is given in the <a href="https://github.com/thaiquangphat/Image-Restoration-in-Frequency-Domain/blob/main/doc/presentation.pdf" target="_blank">
presentation file</a>. This document contains a step-by-step instruction of how to obtain resulted images.

## Experimental Results
Our result shows that the resulting degraded function is estimated to be the Gaussian filter function. 

First of all, we successfully recover the crosshair image to the best.

As the document presented, here is the result obtained using the Gaussian filter.
